Independence must also be observed between samples because a 2-sample mean t-test tests independent samples only.

            <h4>When do we use a 2-Sample Mean T-Test?</h4>
            <p>
              We use a 2-Sample Mean t-Test when we want to test the difference between two means of different populations.
            </p>

            <h4>The T-Distribution:</h4>
            <p>
              The t-distribution is a probability distribution used in inferential statistics‚Äîspecifically when you are estimating or testing the mean of a population and the population standard deviation is unknown.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>bell-shaped</li>
              <li>symmetric about the mean</li>
              <li>the mean, median, and mode are 0 (and at the center of the distribution)</li>
              <li>the curve never touches the x-axis</li>
              <li>ùúé¬≤ is greater than 1</li>
              <li>the t-distribution curve depends on the degrees of freedom*</li>
              <li>as n increases, the t-distribution approaches the standard normal distribution</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <em>*For this type of hypothesis test, the degrees of freedom (d.f.) is n-1</em>
            </p>

            <img src="/diagram1.png" alt="Description" style={{ width: '400px' }} />
            
            <p>
              <strong>T-critical values (t<sub>CV</sub>)</strong> are found on the t-table linked here on page 5: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eQ3-l8sAY6Is8IaZ2yCx4hA0NBESdO3K/view?pli=1">AP Statistics Reference Tables.pdf - Google Drive</a>. To use it, find the appropriate alpha value and d.f., and refer to the corresponding t-value.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Conservative Rule:</strong> When our degrees of freedom are not listed on the t table, we round down to the next lowest d.f. (must be noted in your work!)
            </p>

            <h4>Need to Know Properties:</h4>
            <p>
              To calculate the test statistic (we assume unequal variances): </p>
            <InlineMath math="\displaystyle t = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) - (\mu_1 - \mu_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}" />
            <p> 
              Calculating the degrees of freedom (d.f.) is a little confusing, because there are two samples, right? To combat this, if working by hand, we take the smaller sample size, n, and set d.f. = n-1. The calculator uses a different formula for degrees of freedom. If you use this value, truncate the d.f. and put a ‚Äú‚âà‚Äù symbol to denote that it is an approximation.
            </p>

            <h4>Hypotheses:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>H<sub>0</sub> (null hypothesis):</strong> Œº‚ÇÅ = Œº‚ÇÇ</li>
              <li><strong>H<sub>a</sub> (alternative hypothesis):</strong>
                <ul>
                  <li>H<sub>a</sub>: Œº‚ÇÅ &gt; Œº‚ÇÇ</li>
                  <li>H<sub>a</sub>: Œº‚ÇÅ &lt; Œº‚ÇÇ</li>
                  <li>H<sub>a</sub>: Œº‚ÇÅ ‚â† Œº‚ÇÇ</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Assumptions:</h4>
            <p>
              A little Gaffney mnemonic‚Ä¶ <strong>RNI!</strong> Randomness, normality, and independence. But this time, we need to check 2 types of independence. Let‚Äôs look at how to check each.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Randomness:</strong> Check that the samples are a random sample taken from the populations of interest.<br />
                <em>pro-Gaffney tip: Don't forget to say the population of interest, that's a whole point. And always put it in context!</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Normality:</strong> Either the population is normally distributed, the CLT applies (n &gt; 30), or we create NPP's for each sample that shows approximate linearity.*
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Independence (within each sample):</strong> 10% condition. As long as the population size is greater than or equal to 10 times the sample size, we can use the formula for standard deviation and proceed with the hypothesis test.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Independence (between both samples):</strong> Check that both samples are independent of one another (e.g. boys and girls are always independent, but students and children are not).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <em>*If you aren't familiar with the CLT or the NPP, visit the 1-Sample Mean T-Test page that has notes and instructions.</em>

            <strong>Problem 1</strong>
            <p>
              A teacher wants to compare the test scores of students who studied with music vs. without music. She randomly selects 2 small groups of students and records their scores:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>With Music</strong>: 82, 90, 76, 88, 85</li>
              <li><strong>Without Music</strong>: 75, 78, 72, 74, 69, 80</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Does the data provide convincing evidence that the mean score is different between the two groups? Use a significance level of Œ±=0.05.</p>

            <strong>Problem 2</strong>
            <p>A nutritionist wants to compare the mean iron levels (mg/day) of teenage boys and girls. She takes independent random samples from each group:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Boys</strong>: n = 35, xÃÑ = 15.3, s<sub>x</sub> = 2.4</li>
              <li><strong>Girls</strong>: n = 30, xÃÑ = 13.8, s<sub>x</sub> = 2.1</li>             
            </ul>
            <p>Does the data provide evidence at the 0.01 significance level that teenage boys consume more iron on average than teenage girls?</p>
